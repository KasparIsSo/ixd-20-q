**Worries**

**Money - In the form of finding a job**

As a student without a consistent source of income, emu finances are constantly a point of worry. From day to day decisions, such as being able to buy lunch, to larger decisions, like purchasing larger items, I am constantly reminded of my current financial situation. From this past summer, I had a taste of making consistent income while living in a city where there was an abundance of things to spend that money on. I miss going out and exploring, trying new experiences, etc. This goes beyond money as my time is occupied by school at the moment, but my outlook is that time is linear and summer will come soon enough.

**Impact - in the form of doing a job**

I’m also worried about my next job and the impact of not only my role but the product(s) that I will be working on. I don’t like working on products that I don’t inherently find valuable. Whether that is the topic in which the product lives in or the what value the product offers, I value working on a project that I can get behind. With an uncertain future, this is another source of worry.

**Complacency - In the form of staying at a job**

I’m worried about complacency. I believe that complacent people are the ones that fall behind because their lack of progression makes them relatively worse compared to those that do. Between good jobs, compliments, high pay, company perks, and more, I see many ways one could get a little too comfortable. I’m constantly worried that I am becoming complacent.

**Dealing**

**Education - In the form of completing school**

Full transparency, school seems like a lot of busy work at this point. From electives to certain portions of projects core classes, I feel that I spend a lot of time working on things that I do not inherently find valuable, or at least they do not affect me in the most efficient way. My outlook on work is that one should spend their time working on things that have high impact on their desirable skills. As an example, while a developer may benefit by learning design, they will benefit more from learning a new technology, at least for developers just starting off. So when I find myself writing essays and doing an extensive amount of research, I’m aware that I’m not using my time as efficiently as possible for furthering my own career. However, it’s my final term and I intent to graduate, so for now I am just ‘dealing’ with it.

**Family - In the form of doing free work**

One of my core values is my family. However, they may not understand what I do or the extent of how busy I am. I’m currently working on some work for a charity that my mom is involved with, but their lack of organization with multiple people messaging me results in an extremely frustrating scenario. However, family is family and this charity does good work, so I am just dealing with it for now.

**Excited**

**Graduation - In the form of the end of one chapter and the beginning of another**

I’ve been in school for a long time. Considering pre, elementary, middle, and high school, then jumping into university where I spend 9 straight terms (including summers) completing my degree, where I then went straight into college with an internship every summer, I have spent a lot of time in school and very little time on break. At the end of this term, I would say that I have spent 23 of my 25 years of life in school, and I am excited to finally be done with it all.
