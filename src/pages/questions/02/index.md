I think it’s hard to ever say you don anything really well. I believe that measuring how good you are is relative, and you may be really good relative to one group of individuals but comparatively bad relative to another. There are exceptions to this of course in terms of competitions that have a definitive winner, but I’ll save that for another time.

In the context of my professional craft, I would say that I spend a lot of my time creatively coding. I want to say I can do that fairly well, but I think I’m only beginning to scrape the surface of it. Looking at great creative coders and generative artists, I know there is a lot more to learn.

Creative coding is extremely interesting to me due to their visual beauty, controlled randomness in it’s generative creation, and the technical complexity behind the scenes. It satisfies both my design and development interests and allows me to virtually create an infinite amount of variations from one project. The technical challenges I face in terms of optimization and introducing new technologies continues to draw me into the art form.

So while I may not consider myself good as I believe that would be dishonest given how much more I know I could learn, I think that I can say that I have a deep interest in it. That interest has evolved into a passion and I am always excited for a chance to work on something more creative with regards to the coding world.
