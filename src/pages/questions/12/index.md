Nothing.

Provided the context is right. I don’t believe that there is anything that can’t be joked about, especially in the right context. In the case of the game “Cards Against Humanity” the success of that game has come from its unapologetic content. Referencing things like slavery, neo-nazism, etc. I believe that participating players have prepared themselves for that level of comedy. Randomly talking about those things in isolation would most likely not be funny, but because it is used int he context of a game, I believe it is perfectly fine. As an example, I’ve laughed at cancer jokes despite my favourite uncle having passed from pancreatic cancer. If you joked about it at his funeral, I would have probably found it to be in bad taste and not funny at all. However, given time to heal from that lost, combined with the joke being funny, I would definitely laugh. Context is key.
