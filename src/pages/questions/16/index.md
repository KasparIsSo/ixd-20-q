**Diversity in Background**

From growing up poor to going to a private school, I have had the privilege to live life with multiple financial perspectives. I believe this is invaluable when designing for digital products as the scalability of products often include multiple financial segments.

**Tolerance for Ambiguity**

It’s impossible to know everything, but work still needs to be done. One of my strongest traits is being able to work in situations without perfect information. This involves leaving yourself with room to be flexible in the event that something comes up.

**Appropriate Concession**

I am not above admitting when I am wrong. I find that too often do people stick to their ideas simply because the idea is theirs. If someone can tell me why we should go with a certain idea and is making good points, I’ll be the first to let go of my idea.

Combining these three factors, I believe this makes me a good candidate for any employer. I think it’s important to be able to see things through multiple lenses as problems are more complex than ever with us having access to more data than ever. Being able to admit that a solution is better than your own allows the team to move forward on projects.
