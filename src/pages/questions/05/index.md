A good life to me is happiness. It’s a combination of my work and my personal life, that being my family.

Happiness in my work

This is defined by being excited by the work that I do. It’s also the happiness I find from completing that work along with the joy from working with people at work. Happiness also extends to the logistical factors associated work, that being the location of the workplace, the flexibility of work environment, the financial compensation, as well as the intangibles of the workplace, such as the culture, the interpersonal relationships, and how much I feel valued.

Happiness in my family

Family means the world to me. For my mom, sister, and brother to be healthy and happy would be fantastic. I envision myself getting married and starting a family, being given the opportunity to be a good father means a lot to me. Being able to provide for my family, even if they don’t need me to, is important to me.
