I think transitioning from high school to university, I actually “reinvented” myself by accepting who I was as a person. Without going into too much detail, I went to a private school despite my family not having the financial means that one would normally think of when thinking about private school. While I am thankful to my parents for giving me that opportunity, it also meant that I often felt as an outcast. When I moved on to university, the vast amount of people that I met, along with the diversity of backgrounds that they had, made me feel more accepting towards my own self. In high school, I may have wanted to fit in and talk about things I knew nothing about just to be a part of the conversation. When I decided that it was okay to be me, I would admit that I knew nothing about that thing.
