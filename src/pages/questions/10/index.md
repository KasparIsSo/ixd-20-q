I’ve always dreamt of just going away to some place for a weekend and being completely disconnected from technology, or at least being inaccessible via messages and calls. Although I haven’t researched it too much, I was thinkings somewhere up north or extending the trip to a week and going to Calgary and being immersed in nature. The reality, so far, has been that I haven’t had the time to do it with projects and school while during the summers I was working and trying to just learn as much as I can given the opportunity. I’m looking forward to going full time and designating vacation time towards this trip. I’ve also thought about delaying the start date of my next job by a month and taking an extended vacation given how many years I’ve been in school. Mentally, I am hoping to do this before the end of 2019.
