I would want to be less stressed. I believe I over value a lot of things and make allow them to cause me stress when in reality they may not be that big of a deal. I often feel drained from just thinking about the things I have to do, even though there may be nothing I could do at that moment.

I’ve tried meditation and other techniques, but it feels like I can’t shake the passive stress. I can’t help but feel that instead of doing these relaxation exercises, I could be checking off things on my to-do list. I know that the key to managing stress is to prioritize one’s mental health, but I think about how much time is left in school and how I just have to push through these final few months instead.
