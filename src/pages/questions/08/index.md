An ideal day for me would be to wake up at a consistent time, go to a job that I find fulfilling, go home to my significant other (and any kids we may have), spend some time together, play some games, then head to bed. I think that I know what I like and what I’m good at, which is design/development and my family, and would want my day to revolve around that. Things that plague day-to-day, like bills, spam emails, running errands, checking social media, etc. are small disturbances that are actually quite annoying. Ideally, I would never be on social media and my phone would only be used in the case of emergencies as well as checking the news. However, with group projects and having to be reachable, I find myself on my phone more often than I would like.

I highly value fun and purpose as they satisfy an outer and inner part of me respectively. If you’re able to achieve both, that is fantastic, like in the case of going out on a date with your significant other. The date itself is most likely fun while spending time together fulfills a deeper purpose to be closer to that person. Work with colleagues you like and are friends with is similar in terms of satisfying both fun and purpose as long as what you’re working on is meaningful.
