I started off poor. My parents had separated and my mom was left raising my sister and myself, alone with no one to turn to. She worked tirelessly to get us out of welfare. From balancing three jobs and raising us to eventually getting her real estate license, my mom’s hard work was reflected in my education. I went from a public school to an art school to a private school. Through this, I was able to gather a variety of perspectives, from being extremely poor to hanging out with very well off friends.

Along the way, I realized that I loved art and math. They felt at odds more often than not and when it came down to making a decision for university, I decided to go the math route, as peer pressure and general perception of a more technical career pushed me there. I started off at the University of Waterloo in Mathematical Physics, but upon realizing my future would be more and more school, I decided to switch majors into Economics. Nearing the end of my university career, I realized that I cared more for design than economic models, and enrolled at Sheridan for Interaction Design. I graduate from Waterloo, and as I shook the university’s chancellor’s hand, he asked me “what’s next for you?” My reply of “I’m in college now” was met with his eyes widening, taking a second, and wishing me the best of luck.

Throughout college, I took on internships and summer work opportunities between every year. I began at a marketing agency called Feast Interactive, where I learnt how to pitch to clients as well as how to validate the success of ads through a variety of metrics. The following summer I considered quitting school by taking on a full time job at Toronto Star as a web visual developers. I learnt to work with data and create interactive visuals for their online platform. I then returned to school in search of something more, and found myself at Shopify, a Canadian e-commerce platform company. There I learnt about how to truly build empathy towards your users. It was also here where I realized that I am at the very beginning of my career and know so little. Being humbled by all the fantastic people working there, I am now looking forward growing and learning in my future endeavours.
