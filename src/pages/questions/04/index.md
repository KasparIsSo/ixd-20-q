**Functional Design**

I value function/usability first, then design. But we’re taught that so I think it’s important to everyone.

**Diversity**

In my opinion, diversity is the hottest topic in design over the past few years. It seems like everyone values diversity, however I value diversity beyond race and gender. I think race and gender have been the hot topics within diversity, but there has been less talk about diversity in background and experience. Perhaps it’s a chip on my shoulder, having gone to the University of Waterloo and being Asian, yet studying Economics instead of engineering, and now entering a more technical role in terms of front end web developer, it feels like I’m just lumped into a group. However, I think my background in economics offers something computer science and engineering students may not have, and vice versa.

**Accessibility**

Accessibility has become an increasingly important topic. I want to say part of this is due to the increasing championing of inclusiveness, which also wraps diversity. I care about accessibility in all forms, but specifically web accessibility. There are now laws in Canada that require websites to be accessible, but those are hard to enforce. Over the summer I learnt so much about web accessibility and it changed the way I thought about it. Rather than something that would be nice to have or being a part of the details section of the project, it should be there from the beginning.
