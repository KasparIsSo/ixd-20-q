I would like to have more extensive computer science knowledge. I think that programming is unbelievable in terms of what it can now do, with artificial intelligence and the scalability of the web. However, it gets complex quickly and I often feel lost when just trying to understand one part. It would help in terms of my work and would help unlock a different way of thinking about problems. I believe that, as designers, we are taught to think in a creative and diverging way while computer science students are taught to think in a different manner, one that involves more critical thinking in terms of identifying and establishing quantitative parameters and starting from there.
