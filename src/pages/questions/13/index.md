**Toronto Raptors**

I’ve been a big fan of the Toronto Raptors since middle school. I believe that the team represents the city well and is an accurate depiction of how Canada operates in the North American market. The whole country rallies behind this team as they are the only Canadian team and I believe that’s how it often is for Canadian products that succeed in North America. Furthermore, the team is just so good right now.

**Gradients**

Honestly, I love gradients. Aside from being visually appealing, there’s some really cool math that’s going on behind the scene to figure out the middle colours.

**Gilroy Sans**

As the font that I use for my website, I love how this font looks as well as how it’s developed and maintained by one individual. I loved typography when I learnt it in school and the fact that this was released independent of a foundry is a testament to the shifting digital economy.

**Visual Studio Code**

This code editor is just amazing. I love everything about it, from the fact that it’s built using web technologies to the amount of community support it has. I believe that web technology is the future of all apps, and the fact that VS code exists and is so powerful further supports that.

**Adidas**

I’ve recently gotten into streetwear and I honestly think that Adidas has some of the coolest products. They embraced the multicultural hype around streetwear and have been including more international styling on their products. From pairing English, German, and Japanese in their styling, the design of most of their stuff is just so clean. They have also been able to attract incredible collaborations with musicians that I am a fan of, such as Kanye and Pharell.
