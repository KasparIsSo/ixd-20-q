As a kid, I often counted the steps while taking the stairs. I wanted to know how many steps it took for a single floor. This was before I understood how measurements worked, so I would use steps as a form of comparing heights of floors. My apartment complex took 13 steps while my school took 23. I would also count the steps it took to get to different parts of the playground from the school when I had recess. I wanted to know which activity was the closest as well as what would be the most efficient way of making my rounds to each activity. I never played soccer because it was the furthest activity and for a 15 minute recess, I would lose multiple minutes just getting to and from. I opted for the basketball courts, which were halfway between the my exit and the soccer field or the playground, which was shorter in distance but was often crowded.

Reflecting this counting habit, I can see how it has affected the way I think as well as why web development intrigues me so much. Optimization in development is about finding the most efficient way of doing things. Not the least lines of code, but the actual shortest computing ways of executing a task. That’s very similar to my childhood habit because “go to the soccer field” sounds short, but in reality it was the most effort to get to.
