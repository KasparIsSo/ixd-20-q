**What is the Big O Notation of this function?**

As I transition into web development, I have constant imposter syndrome regarding my technical ability. Meeting other front end developers, I feel as if it is more common for them to have a computer science degree of some sort rather than not. As a result, I am worried of being asked technical computer science questions.

Web development is incredibly complex and is only getting more and more so. The front end of the web has its own back end, which means that calling yourself a web developer is not as simple as just being able to create the UI. With that being said, I would dread being asked more technical computer science questions while interviewing for a web developer position since my lack of knowledge may come off as wasting their time, while the job title is ambiguous by today’s standards.
