My greatest accomplishment would have to be getting my past internship at Shopify, a Canadian e-commerce platform software company. Aside from it being one of the best places to work in Canada, it also marked a successful transition from interaction designer to front end web developer. I used to think I just made novice websites and that I coded more for play and less for scalability. I probably was, but getting this internship felt like I could actually do what developers had to do.

The fact that it was a bigger name was also nice. While I wish the world doesn’t rely on association, this past summer showed me how much weight a name holds. From going to a couple of networking events to just seeing old friends, I realized that slapping a bigger company’s name on your resume opens up opportunities. Places and people that wouldn’t normally have given me the time of day were now reaching out and trying to recruit me. Past locations where I’ve applied to and never got a reply were now sending me LinkedIn requests and asking me to come in for interviews. I hate the networking side of this industry, and this was another reason to dislike it more. However, at the end of the day I would rather have the options open to me than not.
