My ‘why’ is my family. My mom raised my sister and myself alone, working her way out of poverty to create a more comfortable life for us. She was able to do this because people gave her opportunities and rewarded her hustle. The fact that she was able to come out from under makes me believe that anyone can. Through our transition from poor to middle-class, I started getting exposed to opportunities that I didn’t have before.

I’ve always been taught to treat others the way you want to be treated. The idea of equality has many different interpretations, but I believe in equality of opportunity. If people didn’t give my mother chances while trying to get us out of government housing we would have never made it out. So who is giving poorer folks opportunities? And who is to say that certain opportunities should be limited to one’s social class or the amount of money in their bank account.

I believe that technology has the opportunity to be the great equalizer. By delivering services online as well as internet becoming more standard in homes, technology’s scalability means that virtually anyone can access a service. But it’s also about the service itself and whether or not that service creates opportunities for its users. From Uber to AirBnb to Shopify, I believe that letting people be their own boss is the same as giving people opportunities that reward them based on how much they want it.
