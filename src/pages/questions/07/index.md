Normally I do not. There are exceptions, but my general perspective on phone calls is that they are conversations, and I would like to give my genuine responses. I feel as if I do better without a script and relying on a back and forth conversation instead.

There are cases where I do rehearse some hypotheticals. For instance, I prepped a little for a phone interview, but it was more preparation in the case they asked me some more technical questions. I don’t practice intros and formalities, but I do believe in trying to get people’s names right, so I may practice that if it looks particularly complicated.
